    Schedule" document attached as Attachment 2.

          Section 2.  Effective January 1, 2011, Section 18.28.010

    DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION
    FEES AND CHARGES

     AUTHORITY AND GENERAL PROVISIONS 

    ?     Authority

    Fees and charges are necessary to provide financial support to
    the Department of Parks and Recreation (the Department) for the
    operation and maintenance of programs, facilities, and park
    grounds.  The revenue generated by these fees constitutes only a
    portion of funds required for operating and maintaining the Park
    System.  All fees collected from park and recreation activities
    and concessions are used exclusively for the Park System, as
    these funds are deposited in the Park and Recreation Fund, not
    the City General Fund.

    Fees and charges are proposed each year by the Department as a
    part of the annual budget process.  Both the Mayor and City
    Council review and, by ordinance, authorize the Department to
    collect these fees and charges.

    ?     General Provisions

    The Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation is
    authorized to establish a fee for requested uses not included in
    this schedule, keeping the Mayor and the City Council advised
    thereof.  The Superintendent of the Department of Parks and
    Recreation is authorized, as provided in Seattle Municipal Code
    (SMC) Chapter 18.28, to waive or reduce any fees in this
    Schedule.

    The Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation is
    authorized, as provided in SMC Chapter 18.28, to establish
    experimental rates, and to engage in special promotional and
    marketing activities to enhance Departmental programs.  These
    include, but are not limited to, use of 2 for 1 coupons, 50%
    discount coupons and free admission days for children.
    Discounts for Senior Adults (age 65 and over) vary per program.
    These types of activities may occur at various Department
    facilities throughout the year.

    The Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation is
    authorized, as provided in SMC Chapters 18.04 and 18.28, to
    approve the free use of Department facilities by the Associated
    Recreation Council, recognized recreation advisory councils, and
    other organizations that are open to the public, that further
    Department goals and programs, and that apply any proceeds to
    Park and Recreation services.

    In addition to the fees and charges identified herein, the user
    may be required to pay any additional Department costs resulting
    from such use, and to pay a reasonable portion of the City's
    costs for traffic control and police services when the user's
    event requires them.  Cancellation of reservations for Parks and
    Recreation facilities or services may result in loss of payment
    or a service charge (see Appendix D).  For further information,
    contact Seattle Parks and Recreation at (206) 684-4075.

    Fees contained in this Fee Schedule shall not apply to permits
    issued pursuant to SMC Chapter 15.35 "Filming."

PERMITS FOR NON-PARK USES of PARK PROPERTY (Revocable Use Permits or
RUPs)

\* General Provisions & Fees

Revocable Permits to Use or Occupy Park Property, commonly called
Revocable Use Permits, are issued by the Superintendent of Parks and
Recreation, under authority of Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 18.12.042,
18.12.045, and 18.12.275, for various short-term or on-going (i.e.,
Limited Term or Continuing Use, respectively) non-park uses of public
land under the control of the Department of Parks and Recreation.
Permits are revocable upon thirty (30) days notice or immediately upon
failure of the Permittee to comply with the terms and conditions of the
Permit. Unauthorized use of park property, including failure to apply
for and obtain a Revocable Use Permit, is unlawful and subject to
enforcement actions or other remedies as specified in SMC 18.30 or other
applicable law.

In accordance with the Policy on Non-Park Uses of Park Lands, as
endorsed by City Council Resolution 29475, it is the policy of the
Department of Parks and Recreation to limit authorized non-park uses of
park land to the fullest extent practicable. Fees and conditions set for
Revocable Use Permits are intended to discourage private, non-park uses
of park lands; encourage the elimination of encroachments; and promote
private and public cooperation in maintenance of park lands in a manner
consistent with a public park-like character.

Consideration of any permit application requires payment of an
Application Fee, unless City action to a public right-of-way resulted in
inaccessibility from other than park property. The Application Fee is
non-refundable. Issuance of a permit requires payment of a Permit Fee
which is:

o a fixed daily fee (i.e., Limited Term permit fee); and/or

o calculated in accordance with a formula (Continuing Use permit fee);
or

o a minimum permit fee.

Application Fees and Permit Fees are set periodically by ordinance.
Under exceptional circumstances, the Superintendent of Parks and
Recreation may waive or reduce the Revocable Use Permit Fee, in
accordance with criteria established by SMC 18.28.030 or SMC 18.28.040.
Creek restoration projects proposed by other City departments are
specifically exempted from permit fees of any kind as the City
recognizes these projects as valuable enhancements to its parks and
recreation assets. In determining whether the Permit Fee should be
waived or reduced, the Superintendent shall be guided by:

o The benefit to the public and the direct benefit to the park system;

o The frequency and/or amount of usage requested;

o The effect on and fairness to other park users;

o Consistency with policies underlying the fee schedule and SMC Chapter
18; and

o The consequences of denying the request.

The Superintendent may, at his or her discretion, authorize the
acceptance of permanent physical improvements, such as constructed
improvements or landscaping, as compensation in lieu of the Permit Fee
in those circumstances where the proposed in lieu compensation can be
shown to be equal to, or greater, in value than the calculated or set
amount of the Permit Fee.

Waiver or reduction of the Permit Fee does not necessarily waive or
reduce other fees, charges, requirements, or obligations in connection
with issuance of a Revocable Use Permit including Application Fee,
Inspection Fee, processing charges, insurance or indemnity requirements,
or restoration requirements.

Limited Term Permit Fee

Limited Term permits may be issued for necessary uses of park property
for brief periods of time, generally expected to be limited to ninety
(90) days or less; however, Limited Term permits may be issued for uses
expected to continue beyond ninety (90) days at the discretion of the
Superintendent of Parks and Recreation. Examples of activities for which
Limited Term permits may be issued include removal of encroachments,
installation of landscaping consistent with Department guidelines,
utility installations, and temporary access.

The Limited Term permit fee will be charged at a daily rate from the
date the permit is issued or the date the use or occupancy of park
property began, whichever is earlier, until the activity is completed
and all conditions of the permit, including restoration of any damage to
park land, have been satisfied. If seasonal factors, such as planting
conditions or construction prohibitions, warrant a delay between the
time the use or occupancy of park property is completed and the time the
restoration is completed, no Permit Fee shall be charged for the interim
period, unless the park land is unavailable for the use or enjoyment of
the public.

If a Revocable Use Permit is issued for a use of park land that is
expected to continue for a limited period of time, such as a Limited
Term permit, but for a period exceeding ninety (90) days, the fee shall
be the daily rate set for Limited Term permits for the first ninety (90)
days; the fee for the period exceeding ninety (90) days shall be
calculated in accordance with the Continuing Use permit fee.

Under no circumstances shall a Limited Term permit fee be converted to a
lesser fee due to extension of the anticipated completion date of the
permitted activity. If upon inspection it is determined that the permit
conditions have not been satisfied, charges for additional daily fees at
the same rate shall accrue until conditions have been satisfied.

Continuing Use Permit Fee

Continuing Use permit fees shall be charged for uses expected to
continue for an extended period of time, generally beyond ninety (90)
days (e.g., encroachments or other non-park uses that will not be
corrected or eliminated within a ninety (90) day period) . Continuing
Use permit fees shall be calculated using a formula based on land Value,
Area of use, a Barrier factor, and a Rate of return (V x A x B x R).

The Value of the park land used shall be determined by calculating the
average of the assessed value per square foot of the benefited property
and the assessed values per square foot of comparable (i.e., similarly
zoned, having similar amenities such as waterfront or view), nearby
(within a distance not to exceed 1,000 feet) non-park properties.

The Area shall be the total of the square footage of park land actually
used or occupied for non-park purposes and/or the square footage of park
land that is subject to a barrier to public use and/or enjoyment.

The Barrier Factor is a multiplier of 1 or less than 1, representing the
extent of barrier to public use and enjoyment, as set by the following
scale. If two or more Barrier Factors may apply, the greater factor
shall apply.

Factor: 1.00 Full use and/or occupancy of area, preventing public use or
occupancy of the area (e.g., a private structure); or creation of a
physical barrier denying public use or access to the area (e.g., a fence
or hedge);

.70 Creation of a perceptual barrier by improvements or actions that
capture the public space for private use (e.g., paving, shrubbery, other
plantings);

.35 Private landscaping or other improvements on park land that violate,
exceed, or are inconsistent with established design guidelines or
reasonable standards intended to preserve the public park-like character
of park lands (e.g., private access drive or walkway in excess of
standard; private lighting or safety railings that exceed a security
function).

The Rate of return (i.e., land capitalization rate) is set at 10%.

Continuing Use permit fees for permit periods of less than twelve (12)
months are payable in full prior to permit issuance. Continuing use
permit fees for permit periods anticipated to continue for twelve (12)
months or more may be pro-rated and annualized and payable in advance
for such annualized date as the Department shall establish. If the
permit period is shorter than anticipated, the permit fees paid in
advance shall be prorated for the time used and over- payment shall be
refunded, except in the case of revocation due to Permittee's failure to
comply with the terms and conditions of the permit, in which case no
refund shall be given. Permits for utility installations, such as
electrical, natural gas, or telephone service, shall be charged as
Limited Term permits, based on the permit period necessary for
installation.

There is no Permit Fee charged for Limited Term permits of ninety (90)
days or less issued expressly to allow the removal or elimination of an
encroachment onto park land .

There is no Permit Fee charged for certain non-park uses of park land
which may be allowable by property right, such as driveway access from
the roadway portion of a park boulevard if access is not available from
any other right-of-way, or pedestrian walkway from a public sidewalk to
the abutting private property, if such uses comply with established
design guidelines or reasonable standards intended to preserve the
public park-like character of park lands.

PROMOTIONAL & MARKETING FEE WAIVERS & REDUCTIONS

The Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation is
authorized, as provided in SMC 18.28.020, to waive or reduce entry or
use fees from those contained in an approved fee schedule in conjunction
with the promotion and marketing of Park and Recreation programs.

EXAMPLES OF FEE WAIVERS & REDUCTIONS

Authorized activities include, but are not limited to, the following
arrangements:

\1. Sponsored days: A sponsored day or activity for which a sponsor pays
the Department a fixed fee, a matching amount, or supplies advertising,
service, or other benefit. In exchange, the Department provides free
public entry use of the facility, or free or reduced entry for a certain
segment of the public (e.g., children under 12, senior citizens, anyone
donating clothing or food for a drive for those in need); for a special
group of the public (e.g., participants in a community parade); or to
the first entrants up to a specified number.

\2. Bonus and prizes: The Department may distribute to users or entrants
an item supplied by the sponsor (e.g., a button, a balloon, literature,
an item of apparel, or a donated prize for an achievement).

\3. Combination tickets: The Superintendent may issue a combination
ticket for use of multiple City facilities or participation in multiple
City events. A combination ticket may also take the form of a reciprocal
discount or credit. For example, presentation of a ticket stub or coupon
from an aquarium in another city may entitle the holder to a credit on
admission to the Seattle Aquarium when a receipt for paid entry to
Seattle's Aquarium entitles the holder to like privileges in the
facility of the other city. In those cases where a combination ticket is
authorized, combining multiple events and facilities:

o The combined ticket price may be less than the amount that would be
paid for each entry or event singly;

o The combined ticket shall expire within a time period after the
ticket's sale or first usage, with said period to be determined by the
Superintendent of the Department of Parks and Recreation or his or her
designee; and

o The City and any other participant organizations shall apportion the
revenue from the combined sale by a ratio or formula.

\4. Discount Coupons: A coupon allowing two people to enter for the
price of one person, or the coupon holder to enter at a reduced rate.
Coupons may be offered through a sponsor who makes a payment to the City
or who provides special advertising in return. For example, the coupon
may accompany an advertisement in a widely distributed publication for
tourists, which contains similar coupons for other attractions. The
Department may also use coupons as a way of reaching out to a group or
segment of the citizenry, who would not attend or use the facility at
the established fee.

\5. Prepaid Passes: During special hours or otherwise, admission may be
sold to a tour company, the organizer of a convention, or an association
at an aggregate fee for all members and the participants may be granted
entry, either as a group or individually, at the hours or on the days
authorized by presenting a ticket or other indication of pre-payment.

\6. Departmental Free or Half-Price Days: "Senior citizens' days" may be
offered during which time people over a minimum age are admitted free; a
free day may be provided for the public to see and enjoy an exhibit
financed through a bond issue or by a public fund-raising drive; on a
"Kids' Day" or "Neighborhood Day," admission may be free for children
and low income adults; a free golf lesson day for kids may be provided;
or free swimming day at our pools may be provided.

\7. Promotional Purposes: The Department may offer extended evening
hours or special discounts during specific periods in the year to
encourage high attendance at our park facilities. Some examples include,
but are not limited to, the following:

\(a) Extended Aquarium hours and special discounts during the summer.

\(b) Extended special discount for swimming fees during the summer.

Approved:

**Department: Parks and Recreation & The Associated Recreation Council**

Page 1 of 3

For community centers, swimming pools, small craft centers and other
recreation providers, it is the policy of Seattle Parks and Recreation
and the Associated Recreation Council that:

? Any person who registers for a class, camp, special event or program
that is cancelled for any reason by the

5.0 DROPPING A CLASS AFTER SECOND SESSION: If a participant drops a
class after the second session of a series, no refund will be given.

6.0 DAY CAMP REFUND: A participant may be issued a refund for a youth or
teen day camp program, if he/she notifies the program coordinator at
least fourteen (14) days prior to the beginning date of the camp. A
service charge of 10% of the fee will be retained by the facility. No
refunds will be made on payments provided as deposits for camps. No
refunds will be made for requests received within fourteen (14) days
prior to the beginning of the camp, unless the space in the camp is
filled.

7.0 TRIPS, OVERNIGHT CAMPS AND EVENTS REFUNDS: Refunds for trips,
overnight camps and special events, minus any non- refundable deposits
and charges, will be issued until fourteen (14) days prior to the date
of the event unless otherwise stated. Cancellation requests received
later than fourteen (14) days prior to the beginning of the event for
any reason, including illness, will not be approved and refunded.
Refunds, minus a service charge deduction of $5.00 or 10% of the fee,
whichever is greater, may be made if the vacancy is filled. No refund
will be made for food, supplies and materials fees.

8.0 FACILITY RENTALS WHILE CLOSED: Facility rentals, which are scheduled
outside normal hours of operation, require full payment for each
reservation, of which a minimum of $50 is non-refundable. Refunds, minus
the $50 non-refundable charge or 10% of the fee, whichever is greater,
may be made if the renter notifies the facility coordinator at least
fourteen (14) days before the scheduled event. Refunds, minus the $50
non-refundable charge or 50% of the fee, whichever is greater, may be
made if the renter notifies the facility coordinator fewer than fourteen
(14) days before the event and the space is rented to someone else. Any
damage deposit collected prior to an event that is not held will be
refunded in full.

9.0 FACILITY RENTALS WHILE OPEN: Facility rentals, which are scheduled
during normal hours of operation, require full payment for each
reservation, of which a minimum of $5 is non- refundable. Refunds, minus
the $5 non-refundable charge or 10% of the fee, whichever is greater,
may be made if the renter notifies the facility coordinator at least
fourteen (14) days before the scheduled event. No refunds are made for
cancellations that occur less than fourteen (14) days before the event.

10.0 YOUTH SPORTS

A refund of all fees paid, less 10% service charge, will be issued if a
player drops from the team before the uniforms are ordered. If a player
drops from the team after the uniforms are ordered, a refund will be
issued minus the cost of the uniform and the 10% service charge. No
refunds will be issued after the first league game is played.

11.0 ADULT SPORTS

If a team drops from league play after the deposit is paid and before
the final payment is due, a refund will only be issued if a team is
found to take the place of the team that wishes to drop from league
play. A service charge of 10% of the fee will be retained by the
facility. No refunds will be issued after the final payment is made
and/or final schedules are drawn.

12.0 NO REFUNDS: We are unable to issue refunds for clothing which has
been used or worn (goggles, swim caps, t-shirts) or for food items,
unless there is a product defect. Exchanges may be made for defective
products.

13.0 OTHER EXCEPTIONS: Occasionally, no refund is available for a
specific program or service, which may include deposits for registration
or rentals. Information on any specific exception is available from
recreation staff prior to payment or purchase.
